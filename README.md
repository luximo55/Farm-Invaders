# Farm Invaders
This is a project that originally started in the beginning of 2022, during a course about Unity programming, later it has been updated multiple times. It has been officially been published on Itch.io in April of 2022. This GitHub repository has been made in May of 2023, starting with the game version 0.3.5.
The assets have been taken from the Unity Asset Store, but all the code has been writen by me.

This project while technically playable and finished, still has a long way to go. I will continue to update the game from time to time.
