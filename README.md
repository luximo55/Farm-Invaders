# Farm Invaders
This is a project that originally started in the beginning of 2022, during a course about Unity programming, later it has been updated multiple times. It has been officially been published on Itch.io in April of 2022. This GitHub repository has been made in May of 2023, starting with the game version 0.3.5.
The assets have been taken from the Unity Asset Store, but all the code has been writen by me.

This project while technically playable and finished, still has a long way to go. I will continue to update the game and later on make my own models for the game. 
Here on GitHub I'll track my progress, store my version history, and making it all available to you. You can suggest changes that will make it in the official version of the game or even make your own version using my code. 

This code it free to use, you can add things on to the code and make your own version or you can take just the code you need, it's free, it's up to you.
